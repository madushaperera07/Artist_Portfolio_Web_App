In order to provide the groundwork for my web application, I began my project adventure by creating the initial front-end components. The backend was then painstakingly created, and a database was used to manage data as I methodically integrated it. I continually improved the application's aesthetics as I went along, resulting in a professional and user-friendly interface. I used Postman to carry out exhaustive testing to check my backend's dependability. For effective management, I also added an admin control page, and I used Bootstrap to improve the layout and general look of Artist Web site.
